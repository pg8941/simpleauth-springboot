Project Report: Spring Boot Authentication Service

**1. Introduction:**

This project is a robust, RESTful authentication and authorization service built using Spring Boot. It provides secure user registration, login, role-based access control, and user management functionalities. It aims to simplify and standardize authentication across various applications and services within the organization, particularly those interacting with USB framework components.

**2. Why Needed:**

Centralized Authentication: Existing authentication mechanisms may be scattered or inconsistent. This service provides a centralized and standardized approach, improving security and maintainability.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Many USB framework applications require fine-grained access control based on user roles. This service enables efficient management of roles and permissions.
Security: Addresses vulnerabilities associated with ad-hoc authentication implementations.
Scalability: Spring Boot's architecture allows for easy scaling as the number of users and applications grows.
Integration: Simplifies integration with other systems and services.
**3. What It Does:**

User Registration: Allows new users to create accounts.
User Login: Authenticates users and provides secure access.
Role Management: Enables admin users to assign and update user roles.
Role-Based Access Control: Protects endpoints based on user roles (e.g., admin dashboard).
User Retrieval: allows a user to be retrieved by username.
**4. Tech Stack:**

Spring Boot: Framework for building RESTful APIs.
Spring Security: Handles authentication and authorization.
Java: Programming language.
MySQL: Database for storing user and role information.
JPA/Hibernate: Object-relational mapping.
Postman: API testing tool.
Git/GitHub: Version control and collaboration.
BCryptPasswordEncoder: Secure password hashing.
**5. Results:**

Successfully implemented secure user registration and login.
Established role-based access control for protected endpoints.
Created a scalable and maintainable authentication service.
Improved security of the system.
Simplified user management.
**6. Tools:**

Eclipse (IDE).
MySQL Workbench or command-line client.

Git.
**7. Technologies:**

RESTful API design.
JSON data format.
HTTP protocol.
Spring Security.
JPA/Hibernate.
**8. Challenges:**

Designing a robust and secure role-based access control system.
Handling database interactions and ensuring data integrity.

**9. Future Scope:**

Implement OAuth 2.0 for third-party authentication.
Add JWT (JSON Web Token) support for stateless authentication.
Integrate with LDAP or Active Directory for enterprise environments.
Implement password reset functionality.
Add more detailed logging.
Add endpoint for user deletion.
Add endpoint for changing user password.
**10. What's New From Present:**

Centralized and standardized authentication.
Fine-grained role-based access control.
Improved security and maintainability.
Scalability for future growth.
Simplified integration with other services.
**11. Input and Output:**

Input:
User registration requests (username, password).
Login requests (username, password).
User role update requests (username, roles).
Username for user retrieval.
Output:
Authentication tokens (or session IDs).
User details (JSON).
Success/error messages (JSON).
**12. Use Cases:**

Securing USB device management applications.
Controlling access to diagnostic tools and logs.
Managing user permissions for firmware updates.
Authenticating users for data analysis and reporting tools.
13. Daily Life Use (Samsung USB Framework Team):

**13. Current uses**
Simplifies authentication for new USB framework applications.
Provides a secure and consistent way to manage user permissions.
Reduces the time and effort required to implement authentication.
Allows you to easily test security related features of the USB framework applications.
**14. For Users:**
Provides a secure and reliable login experience.
Ensures that users only have access to authorized features.
Protects sensitive data and operations.

**15. System Architecture Diagram:**

    A[Client (Postman, UI, etc.)] -->|HTTP Requests| B(Spring Boot Authentication Service);
    B -->|Database Queries| C[MySQL Database];
    B -->|Authentication/Authorization| D[Spring Security];
    B -->|Data Transfer| E[JSON];
    D --> C;
Explanation:

Client: Represents any application or user interface that interacts with the authentication service (e.g., Postman for testing, a web UI, or another application).
Spring Boot Authentication Service: The core application that handles authentication, authorization, and user management.
MySQL Database: Stores user data, roles, and user-role relationships.
Spring Security: Manages authentication and authorization logic.
JSON: The data format used for communication between the client and the service.

17. Data Flow Diagram (Example: User Registration):


sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant UserController
    participant UserService
    participant UserRepository
    participant MySQL Database

    Client->>UserController: POST /register (RegistrationRequest)
    UserController->>UserService: registerUser(RegistrationRequest)
    UserService->>UserRepository: save(User)
    UserRepository->>MySQL Database: INSERT INTO users
    MySQL Database-->>UserRepository: Success
    UserRepository-->>UserService: User Object
    UserService-->>UserController: User Object
    UserController-->>Client: 200 OK (User Registered)
Explanation:

The client sends a POST request to the /register endpoint with user registration details.
The UserController delegates the registration logic to the UserService.
The UserService uses the UserRepository to save the user data to the database.
The database confirms the successful insertion.
The user object is returned, and then a 200 ok response is sent to the client.
